  <h1>Initial Findings from Cortex Connections</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this project, I analyzed the functional connectivity patterns in the brains of ADHD and neurotypical individuals
    using advanced techniques such as dictionary learning and region extraction.</p>
  <h2>Key Observations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Neurotypical brains achieved the same level of correlation between regions as ADHD brains but with less effort.
    </li>
    <li>The activated regions in ADHD brains, as shown in the dictionary learning maps and region extraction maps, are
      larger and more diffuse compared to the more focused activation in neurotypical brains.</li>
    <li>Despite the larger and more diffuse activation in ADHD brains, the connectome and correlation matrices showed
      similar levels of unity in both groups.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Visual Evidence</h2>
  <p>Visual representations of my findings, demonstrating the differences in brain activation and connectivity between
    ADHD and neurotypical groups, are available in the <strong>Visuals</strong> tab.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dictionary Learning Maps show larger, more diffuse activation in ADHD brains.</li>
    <li>Region Extraction Maps highlight the extent of activated regions in both groups.</li>
    <li>Correlation Plots and Matrices illustrate the functional connectivity patterns, showing similar correlation
      levels despite differences in activation size.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <p>Further analysis will be conducted to explore these initial findings in more detail. Upcoming work includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detailed comparison of connectivity patterns across different tasks and events.</li>
    <li>Identification of specific brain regions that show the most significant differences between ADHD and
      neurotypical groups.</li>
    <li>Exploration of the seed-based connectivity analysis to further validate and expand on these observations.</li>
  </ul>
